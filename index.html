                        Through the 1960s and 1970s, the birth rate in Bangladesh was among the highest in the world but that started to slow down considerably in the 1980s. The fertility rate is now at 2.4 children born per woman. Bangladesh has a fairly young population with 34% aged 15 and younger and just 5% aged 65 and older.</p>

                        <h1>Bangladesh Population Projections</h1>
                        <p>The rate of growth has been slowing steadily for quite a while, and that trend is expected to continue further into the 21st century. The country is currently growing at an annual rate of around 1%, but this is expected to halve by 2040. Bangladesh is expected to reach a population of 170 million by 2020, and 186 million by 2030.</p>
